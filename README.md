# Movies-ETL

The Amazing Prime Video team asked for my help to develop an algorithm which low budget movies being released will become popular so they can buy the streamin rights.

I needed to extract data from two different data sources: a scrape from Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990, and rating data from the Movie Land's website, transformed it into a clean data set and loaded that data set into SQL table.
